Diagram 1 Overview
This diagram appears to represent the core modules of a Mac-based tool (labeled “Mac Tool for DMC”) that guides users through metadata extraction and subsequent processing. Key points include:

User Interface & Input:
– An interface (“Mac Os - Web app UI”) prompts the user to select a folder containing OCF files and choose a camera type (e.g., ARRI, Sony, Red).

Metadata Extraction Module:
– A class called ExtractOCFMetadata takes a file path as input and returns metadata as a JSON dictionary.
– It uses different CLI commands (e.g., arimxf_cli, redline_cli, rawviewer_cli) depending on the camera type.

JSON Generation:
– SaveJsonMetadata is responsible for reading filenames from a transcodes folder, parsing the associated OCF parent folder to obtain file paths, and then passing these to the metadata extractor to save JSON files.

Post-Processing:
– ProcessMetadata accepts a source name and a centralized JSON folder path. It copies JSON files to the corresponding shot folders and publishes the metadata to Ftrack (a production tracking tool).

Flame Integration:
– A separate module, Flame Hook, takes a list of selections and then exports plates, retrieves metadata, and publishes clips along with metadata back to Ftrack.

Implementation Languages:
– There are labels indicating that parts of this workflow are implemented in Python and JavaScript. For example, the extraction and processing steps are Python-based while the UI appears to be web-based (HTML/JavaScript).

Diagram 2 Overview
The second diagram expands the view by positioning the metadata extraction process within a broader context, highlighting data inputs from various vendors and subsequent integration into a post-production workflow.

Three Main Zones:

Left – Source Vendors:
– Contains nodes like OCF – ARRI, OCF – SONY, OCF – RED, and OCF – OTHER.
– Each vendor’s transcode files have the issue that “TRANSCODED Metadata are lost,” which signals the need to re‐acquire metadata from the original files.

Center – Metadata Extraction:
– The central block (“Extract Metadata: MacOs tool(s) – CLI –> Python”) covers the extraction process.
– Different CLI tools (e.g., arimxf CLI, raw viewer CLI?, REDLine CLI, and a tool using exiftool/oiio/EXRreader for other cases) are used to process OCF files.
– A dedicated block describes the steps: “From Transcoded file, retrieve the name; Find corresponding OCF; Read metadata from OCF; Create json dict; Save json file to centralized folder.”

Right – Post-Production & Publishing:
– Labeled Flame Work + Hooks, this area involves post-processing tasks such as conforming media, assigning shot names, and associating source names with JSON files.
– A subsequent PUBLISH module then routes outputs to several endpoints: sending plates to a server, publishing plates to Ftrack, and delivering metadata both to server folders and directly to Ftrack.

Workflow Arrows:
– Dashed and solid arrows indicate the data flow:

From vendor nodes (with lost metadata) toward CLI extraction tools.
From CLI tools into the central JSON creation process.
Then from the JSON output to the Flame Work module.
Finally, publishing outputs to various targets.
Integration Emphasis:
– The diagram shows how metadata extraction (handled in Python via CLI tools on macOS) feeds into a workflow that automates conforming and publishing in Flame and Ftrack, addressing the problem of missing metadata in transcoded files.

Comparative Analysis & Observations
Modular Breakdown:
Both diagrams highlight a modular approach. Diagram 1 focuses on the individual classes (ExtractOCFMetadata, SaveJsonMetadata, ProcessMetadata, and Flame Hook) that form the tool’s backbone. Diagram 2 zooms out to place these modules in context with external inputs (different vendors’ media) and outputs (server and Ftrack).

Language and Integration Layers:
– There is a clear separation between the extraction/processing logic (Python-based CLI tools) and the user interface (web/JavaScript), as well as the integration layer (Flame Hook) that connects the processing outputs to post-production systems.

Problem Addressed:
– The recurring theme is the loss of metadata in transcoded files. The system remedies this by parsing the original OCF files (through specialized CLI commands) to generate JSON metadata that is then used to drive downstream workflows in Flame and Ftrack.

Workflow Flow:
– Diagram 1 gives a step-by-step view of the tool’s operation on the Mac, while Diagram 2 emphasizes the overall data journey from raw media (or vendor sources) through metadata extraction to final publishing.

Summary
The provided Draw.io XML files collectively depict a multi-part tool designed to:

Allow users to select media folders and specify camera types.
Extract metadata from original camera files using dedicated CLI tools.
Convert that metadata into JSON files via a dedicated module.
Process the JSON to integrate with shot folders and publish metadata to Ftrack.
Further integrate with Flame (through a dedicated hook) for conforming and exporting plates.
This integrated approach solves the challenge of lost metadata in transcoded files by re-acquiring the necessary information from the original OCF files and streamlining the subsequent post-production workflows.

second response:
Below is an overview of what the two diagrams reveal about your tool’s architecture and workflow:

1) Overall Structure and Components
• The first diagram (xml #1) breaks down the process into three main classes/modules:
  – ExtractOCFMetadata: This component is responsible for taking a file path as input, reading the OCF (Open Content Format) metadata, and returning it as a JSON dictionary. It supports different methods based on camera type (e.g., ARRI, Sony, Red).
  – SaveJsonMetadata: This module handles parsing a folder (containing transcodes and OCN parent folders) to identify transcode filenames. It then uses the ExtractOCFMetadata object to generate JSON metadata files.
  – ProcessMetadata (Flame Hook): Operating within the Flame Hook context, this class takes a source name and a centralized JSON folder path to locate and link JSON files. It then publishes metadata (and associated plates) to Ftrack while also copying the JSON to the shot folder.
• An Interface (Mac Os – Web app UI) is also depicted, guiding the user through folder selection and camera type selection before triggering the process.

2) Integration and Technology
• There is a clear separation between the extraction/creation of metadata (handled by the Mac Tool for DMC in Python) and the post-processing/publishing of that metadata (handled via Flame Hooks, also in Python).
• The UI is built as a web app (with a nod to JavaScript in the diagram), which serves as the front end for initiating the process.

3) High-Level Workflow (from the second diagram, xml #2)
• The diagram divides the overall process into three vertical blocks:
  – OCF and Transcodes (External Vendor): Indicates that OCF files and transcoded files may originate from an external source.
  – Extract Metadata (MacOs CLI Tools in Python): Shows that based on the camera type (ARRI, SONY, RED, OTHER), different CLI tools (e.g., arimxf CLI, raw viewer CLI, REDLine CLI) are used to extract metadata. A central processing block describes the steps: retrieving the name from a transcoded file, finding the corresponding OCF, reading its metadata, creating a JSON dict, and saving the file to a centralized folder.
  – Flame Work + Hooks: After metadata extraction, this part handles conforming (assigning shot names, associating sources, etc.) and then “publishing” the data. The publishing process is further split into sending plates and metadata to servers and to Ftrack. • The dashed connectors and distinct color codings emphasize integration between extraction (using CLI tools) and post-processing (using Flame Hooks).

4) Summary of the Workflow
• A user selects a folder and a camera type through the Mac OS web UI.
• The SaveJsonMetadata module scans for transcode files, identifies related OCF parent folders, and calls ExtractOCFMetadata to pull metadata into JSON format.
• The generated JSON metadata is then fed into the ProcessMetadata (Flame Hook) module, which further processes it by creating symlinks, assigning shot names, and publishing the metadata (and plates) to both a server location and Ftrack.

In essence, the diagrams show a modular and layered design where different technologies (Python for CLI and processing, JavaScript for the UI) interact to extract, process, and publish metadata, all while accommodating multiple camera formats.

My next question:
to go a bit further:
I started a skeleton where wep_app is the parent folder of the project.
Things are so far organized as:
wep_app/scripts/extract_ocf_metadata.py
wep_app/scripts/save_json_metadata.py
attached are 2 basis for the python classes.

Feel free to use or not the 2 attached files.

I'd like to create a local webapp with a front page that allows to:
- select a folder on our system to parse and find certain types of files
- let the user select the type of files to look for and extract metadata from
- display a list of found files to the user
- let the user pick (or enter the path manually) a destination folder to save the created json files.
- let the user start the process by clicking a button ("Generate json files" )

The name of the json files should be the name of the source files (minus their original extension) and with a .json extension.

Then I need the logic for the 2 classes (extract and save) but leaving the CLI commands parts as dummies.

If it doesn't make sense to have the 2 classes in 2 separate files, then modify the structure's idea so it makes more sense, or it's more efficient.

Don't bother with the Flame Hook or Flame work part, let's just create a dummy.

====================
reponse, along with the code:
How It Works

1) Home Page (/)
The user enters a source folder and a file extension filter (e.g., ".mxf").
On submission, the form posts to /search.

2) Search Page (/search)
The server verifies the source folder exists and recursively searches for files matching the extension.
The found files are displayed.
A second form is shown where the user enters a destination folder.

3) Generation (/generate)
The destination folder is verified.
For each found file, an instance of SaveJsonMetadata is created. Its dummy extract() method returns dummy metadata, and then save() writes a JSON file (named after the source file, with a .json extension) into the destination folder.
A results page lists the paths of the generated JSON files.

- Final Notes
The “dummy” parts in the class methods (e.g., extract()) are placeholders where you can later integrate your actual CLI logic.
If you eventually find that merging the two classes into one file makes your logic cleaner, you can refactor the code. For now, keeping them separate respects your original design.
Since browsers don’t have native folder pickers that work reliably for local paths, the UI uses text fields for folder paths. In a more advanced desktop/web hybrid environment, you might integrate a file picker.
This skeleton should provide a solid starting point for your local webapp, with clear separation between the web interface and your backend processing logic.

My next question:
How can I run this locally (use conda for virtual environments)
====================
Resonse:

You can create and manage your virtual environment with Conda. Here's how to do it step by step:

1) Create a Conda Environment:
Open your terminal and run (bash):
conda create --name wep_app python=3.8
=> You can replace 3.8 with the desired Python version.

2) Activate the Environment (bash):
conda activate wep_app

3) Install Flask:
=> You can install Flask via pip within your Conda environment:
bash:
pip install Flask
=> Alternatively, if you prefer using Conda packages:
bash:
conda install -c conda-forge flask

4) Set Environment Variables (Optional):
To tell Flask which file to run, set the FLASK_APP variable:

On macOS/Linux:
bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py

On Windows (in Command Prompt):
set FLASK_APP=app.py

If you're using PowerShell, use:
$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"

5) Run the Flask App:
=> With your environment activated, run:
bash:
python app.py
=> or if you prefer:
bash:
flask run

6) Access the Web App:
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see your application running locally.

These steps will set up a Conda virtual environment for your project and run your local webapp.
